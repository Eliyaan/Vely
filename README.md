# Vely

This project's goal is to facilitate the learning of a real programming language for begginers by using blocks and visual programming.

The goal is that when people who never touched code see others programming with Vely, instead of them thinking "Huh programming is scarry, I dont understand anything", they think "Oh tthat seems fun and easy!".
And instead of giving them very little liberty to express their ideas (or with greater difficuly), something that bothered me a lot when trying to learn programming, they will have access to all the power of a real programming language, V.

Using blocks, they will not need to learn the syntax and just try the things they want. By doing that they will learn the logic behind programming without any time spent trying to learn what they can do and cannot, so that they can jump right into it.
And also for those who want to then try text-based programming, there will be ways to ease this transition in Vely.


If you need any help or have any questions, feel free to ask here (by opening an issue or on discord `nopana`)!
