next steps:

[x] block snapping

[x] block resizing

[x] input text field

[ ] side menu for selecting options

[x] detach groups

[ ] v file generating

[ ] button to launch the program & compile

[ ] camera pan

work on the blocks


Big Steps:
- support  basic/common V syntax via blocks[WIP]
- reading Vely generated V files into Vely
- support module import (so more powerful V code reader) & more syntax with blocks
- create a way to simply make graphical games/apps (like Scratch) (gg or sdl abstraction maybe?)
- support all V importing/exporting
