next steps:

- [x] block snapping
- [x] block resizing
- [x] input text field
- [x] detach groups
- [x] v file generating
- [x] button to launch the program & compile
- [ ] camera pan
- [ ] support for _, ", ', space, &, <, >, , , ., all the special chars
- [ ] working ButtonTs 

work on the blocks & help menu

### Important thinking
side menu for selecting options ? or better option  

lots of safety measures (not able to input an already used name, types...)



Big Steps:
- support  basic/common V syntax via blocks[WIP]
- reading Vely generated V files into Vely
- support module import (so more powerful V code reader) & more syntax with blocks
- create a way to simply make graphical games/apps (like Scratch) (gg or sdl abstraction maybe?)
- support all V importing/exporting
